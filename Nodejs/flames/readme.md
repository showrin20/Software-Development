# FLAMES

FLAMES is a classic and playful name game that predicts the type of relationship between two people based on their names. The acronym FLAMES stands for <strong>Friends, Love, Affection, Marriage, Enemy, and Siblings</strong>. It originated in schools, especially in India and other South Asian countries, as a fun activity among friends and classmates. Although it has no scientific basis, FLAMES became popular because it is easy to play with pen and paper and gives entertaining “predictions.” The game works by removing common letters between two names, counting the remaining letters, and
cycling through the letters of FLAMES to determine the relationship type. Even today, it remains a nostalgic and lighthearted love game enjoyed by students and social media users alike.
